		<h1>Hello! I'm Shahida Begum.</h1>
		<p>I'm from chattogram. I'm a banker but dream to be a succesfull freelancer. In Shikhbe Shobai, it's my third course. Previously I've done two courses on Graphic and UI Design. Now I'm also working as a Graphic Designer at Fiverr marketplace. It's very tough for me to complete those courses, even I was drop out from my first course, but I didn't give up my dream. Hope one day I'll leave that unpleasant job and become a full time successfull freelancer. Thank you.</p>
